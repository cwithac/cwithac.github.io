          <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
          <p>Two players alternate turns playing a red chip or a black chip by clicking on an empty space.  Plays must be made from the bottom of the game board upward, as if chips would fall due to gravity.  Available spaces to play will highlight in gray.  The round ends when either player achieves four discs in a row, column, or diagonally. If the game board fills before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.</p>
          <p>Choose <span class="highlight-word">play again</span> to keep the score tally running but play a new game.  Choose <span class="highlight-word">start over</span> to reset both the gameboard and scoreboard.</p>
